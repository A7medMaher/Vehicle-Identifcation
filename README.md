# Vehicle-Identifcation

This repository contains the necessary codes to implement vehicle identification based on their license plates. I have used python programing language
with the follwoing:
1- tensorflow object detection API: To implement license plate detection
2- OpenCv: To implement post-processing procedures, KNN algorithm is used to carry out LP recognition phase.


This was a part of a complete system to recognize and track a vehicle based on its LP. The complete system is shown in :
